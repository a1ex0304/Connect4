# Connect4
This project is a digital recreation of the classic Connect 4 game, developed using Java for the backend logic and Java Swing to create a dynamic and interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The game faithfully replicates the original gameplay mechanics, offering a visually intuitive and engaging platform for two players. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent by strategically aligning four discs of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, featuring clear visual cues and smooth animations to enhance the overall playing experience. This digital version of Connect 4 brings the timeless fun of the physical game to the virtual world, providing an enjoyable and competitive environment for players of all ages.
